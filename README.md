## About me

I'm learning to code for almost 10 years. Starting from scratch with C++, growing up with Java/Python, and then fallen in love with Kotlin + Android. As soon as I got along with Kotlin I didn't write a single line of Java. It was so great feeling to create apps that can be actually usable by millions of users on daily basis. Currently working on big international commercial projects in Netguru.

#### Hobbies
I love esports (mainly LoL) and I'd love to attend esports events. Watching every ski jumping contest. Watching and reading a lot of mobile technology blogs. Also I'm listening a lot of electro-house music and reading/watching sci-fi and fantasy.
