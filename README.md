## About me

Learning programming for 6 years already. Started with C++ and simple console projects. Then I decided to take up studies on GdaÅ„sk University of Technology on field of Automation and Robotics where I discovered Java, C# and HTML. At university I gained some skills in solo and group programming projects. One of them was simple Android app that sends view from camera to python server on PC via sockets for image processing purposes. I joined Android app crew. Learning was not that easy at the begging, but when I gained some skills to deal with first widgets, it was super exciting that you get product that can be actually useful for everyone in the age of smartphones.

#### Hobbies
I love esports (mainly LoL) and I'd love to attend esports events. Watching every ski jumping contest. Also I'm listening a lot of electro-house music and reading/watching sci-fi and fantasy.
