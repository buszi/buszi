# Public Projects:

## [News :newspaper:](https://github.com/buszi0809/News)

Search for articles with advanced query parameters, read preview of received results and save the ones you find useful. You can read them by opening in browser and share them with friends. Searching is powered by [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/). You can search by:
- phrase in title or whole article
- date of publication
- language
- sort them by date, relevancy or popularity

#### Code is organized in MVVM architecture and connected with use of Dagger Hilt dependency injection. Search engine is operated with Retrofit. Results are presented with use of Paging 3 library, Data Binding together with View Binding, LiveData and Kotlin Flows. Navigation is held with use of Single Activity pattern and Navigation Component. Navigation parameters are passed with SafeArgs. Tests are made with usage of JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, and Truth assertions with custom tests runner (for Dagger Hilt testing), rules (e.g. to set main coroutines dispatcher), view assertions and actions (e.g. for testing BottomSheetBehaviour), mock argument matcher.

## [Cigarettes :smoking:](https://github.com/buszi0809/Cigarettes)

App that helps user with quitting smoking. It tracks progress in time, money saved, milestones and previous attempts to help you organize and motivate. With usage of service and foreground notification you can always stay in touch with your progress, even if app is not currently in use. App also gets news feed from [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/) and displays health care articles about smoking cigarettes (news are updated daily and cached on device).

App is organized in MVVM architecture with usage of Koin, Room, KTX, Material Design, Donut, Retrofit, Glide, Gson, Coroutines and some tests with usage of JUnit and Truth :sweat_smile:.

## About me

Learning programming for 6 years already. Started with C++ and simple console projects. Then I decided to take up studies on GdaÅ„sk University of Technology on field of 
Automation and Robotics where I discovered Java, C# and HTML. At university I gained some skills in solo and group programming projects. One of them was simple Android app that sends view from camera to python server on PC via sockets for image processing purposes. I joined Android app crew. Learning was not that easy at the begging, but when I gained some skills to deal with first widgets, it was super exciting that you get product that can be actually useful for everyone in the age of smartphones. Now I'm on third grade of studies, but in reality I'm spending most of free time coding new apps and expanding my skills and tech stack in Android. I'm really determined to start a real job as Kotlin Android Developer, expand my skills and work on real commercial projects full-time. I'd like to expand my stack with iOS but I can't really afford Apple devices that are necessary to run a project.

#### Hobbies
I love esports (mainly LoL) and I'd love to attend esports events. Also I'm listening a lot of electro-house music.
