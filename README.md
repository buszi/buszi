## About me

Starting from scratch with C++, growing up with Java/Python, and then falling in love with Kotlin + Android. As soon as I got along with Kotlin I didn't write a single line of Java. It was a great feeling to create scalable apps that are easy to read and will be usable by millions of users daily.

#### Hobbies
I love esports (mainly LoL). I watch and read a lot about mobile technology blogs. Also, I'm listening to a lot of electro-house music and reading/watching sci-fi and fantasy.
