It tracks progress in time, money saved, milestones and previous attempts to help you organize and motivate. With usage of service and foreground notification you can always stay in touch with your progress, even if app is not currently in use.

## About me

Studying programming for 6 years already. Started with C++ and simple console profects. Then i decided to countinue studying on GdaÅ„sk University of Technology on field of 
Automation and Robotics where i discovered Java, C# and HTML. At university i gained some skills in solo and group programming projects. One of them was simple Android app that sends view from camera to python server on PC via sockets for image processing purposes. I joined Android app crew. Learning was not that easy at the begging, but when i gained some skills to deal with first widgets, it was super exciting that you get product that can be actually useful for everyone in the age of smartphones. When the pandemy started i decided to go all in and focus on Android with usage of Kotlin. Now i'm at third grade of studies, but what i really want is to start real job as Kotlin Android Developer.

#### Hobbies
I love esports (mainly LoL) and i'd love to attend esports events. I'm watching every main Ski Jumping contest. Also im listening a lot of electro-house music.
