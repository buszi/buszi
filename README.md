## About me

Starting from scratch with C++, growing up with Java/Python, and then fallen in love with Kotlin + Android. As soon as I got along with Kotlin I didn't write a single line of Java. It was so great feeling to create apps that are scalable, easy to read, and will be actually usable by millions of users on daily basis.

#### Hobbies
I love esports (mainly LoL). Watching and reading a lot about mobile technology blogs. Also I'm listening a lot of electro-house music and reading/watching sci-fi and fantasy.
